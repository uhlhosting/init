          An **Action Item** is a task to be completed by a specific team member. 

          > *But wait … didn’t we just create an **issue** assigned to a team member?* What’s the difference? 

          At a glance:

          * **Issue** - work that needs to be completed 
          * **Action Item** - an individual’s responsibility to complete that work

          When an issue is created with the status of “Todo” and assigned to a team member, that team member receives a corresponding Action Item in their personal Planner.

          Let’s see how the issue status is *automatically updated* based on an individual team member’s progress towards their Action Item. Let’s go!

          ---

          ### Task 4 - Schedule your first Action Item

          Remember that issue you just created in the previous step? Because you set the issue status to “Todo” and assigned it to yourself, you’ve received a corresponding Action Item for that issue.

          Head over to your Planner by clicking the calendar icon in the left sidebar. Here, you’ll see an Action Item for the issue you just created!

          There are 2 ways to schedule an Action Item:

          * Click and drag the Action Item to your calendar on the right, *or*
          * Click on the Action Item ****to open it in the right side panel. Click `Add Slot` to create a time slot representing when you plan to do the work. From there, you can adjust the day and time and add more slots if needed.

          Notice that when you schedule an Action Item, it moves from “Unplanned” to “Scheduled” on your list.

          Now, navigate back to the Tracker by clicking the checkbox icon in the left side panel. Notice that the status of your issue *automatically updated* to “In Progress”! That’s because you scheduled your Action Item, indicating your commitment to completing the work.

          ![](image://file?file=${gif4}&width=1440)

          If you’d like, go ahead back to your Planner and check off your Action Item by clicking the round checkbox that appears when you hover over it. You’ll see that the issue status automatically updates to “Done”.

          ### Task 3 - Create your first issue

          Let’s create your first issue in Huly!

          Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the stop of the side panel (or simply press `C` from any view!). This will open a dialog where you can enter some initial settings for your issue. 

          > **Tip:** By default, the issue will be associated with the project you’re currently viewing. You can change this to the project you just created by selecting it from the dropdown in the top left corner.

          Next, enter some information about your issue: 

          * Provide a **title** and **description**. 
          * Choose some settings, such as **priority**, **labels**, **estimation** and **due date**. 
          * The **assignee** will be the default assignee you selected for your project.
          * ❗ Ensure that the **status** is set to “Todo” — *this is important for the next step!*

          When you’re ready, click `Create issue`!

          * Hover over **YOUR PROJECTS** and click the `+` icon that appears, *or*
          * Click the dropdown menu next to the `+ New issue` button and select `Create project`. 

          A **title** and **default assignee** are required. You can also add a **description**, choose a custom **identifier** and select an **icon** for your project. 

          Next, click `Create`!

          # **Creating a teamspace**

          Documents are organized into teamspaces, which can be used to model your team’s organizational structure. For example, you may choose to organize your documents into teamspaces called “Features”, “Marketing”, “Style Guides” etc.

          To create a teamspace, click the `+` that appears when hovering over the word “Teamspaces” in the sidebar, or by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the `+ Create a Document` button and selecting `Create teamspace`.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif1}&width=1440)

          # **Creating a document**

          There are two ways to create a document:

          Click the `+ Create a document` button at the top of the sidebar. This opens a dialog with the option to select a teamspace for your document; the default parent will be the most recently selected teamspace or document. Enter a title for your document and click `Create`.

          Alternatively, hover over the a teamspace name or any other document and click the `+` button that appears. The new document will automatically be nested within the teamspace or document you selected.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif2}&width=1440)

          # **Formatting document content**

          Documents support markdown formatting. There are a few ways to access formatting options for your text:

          Type markdown syntax directly into your document.

          Use the floating toolbar that appears when text is selected on the page.

          Formatting options include headers, text emphasis, links, blockquotes, numbered and bulleted lists, and code blocks.

          Images, tables and separator lines are also available by hovering over text and clicking the `+` icon that appears on the left side.

          # **Enrich your documents with @mentions, Action Items and live collaboration**

          Documents are directly integrated within the rest of the Huly platform, making it easy to tag team members, assign Action Items and link to issues. Team members can collaborate in real time, eliminating the need to send files back and forth or meet to discuss revisions.

          # **Mentions**

          Mention a team member by using @mention syntax. The member will receive a notification that they have been mentioned in the document. 

          # **Creating Action Items**

          Create an Action Item by typing `[]` then `space` on a new line. Alternatively, type `/` and select `Action Item` from the dropdown menu. An empty checkbox will appear, and as you begin typing, a profile icon will appear to the left of the checkbox. Click this icon to select a team member to assign the Action Item to. That team member will receive a notification that they have been assigned an Action Item, and they’ll be able to schedule the Action Item in their Planner.

          * [ ] You can assign an Action Item any time by hovering over the checkbox and clicking the profile icon. 
          * [ ] Try assigning these Action Items to yourself!

          # **Real-time collaboration**

          Team members can collaborate on documents at the same time! Multiple people can edit and add to documents simultaneously. Check out our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspdJ5TjFNQ) to learn more about collaborative editing in Huly documents!

          Huly’s **Team Planner** is a powerful tool that provides a bird's-eye view of your team's workflow, enhancing collaboration and efficiency. This is a dedicated space where you can see your team's scheduled activities and progress. 

          You can access your Team Planner any time by clicking the sun icon in the left sidebar. It won’t look like much until your team starts using Huly to schedule Action Items, but let’s dive in deeper into how this feature can improve your workflows!

          # **Understand your team’s agenda at a glance**

          - **View Action Items:** On your Team Planner, you can see a clear agenda of what's planned for today and tomorrow. This immediate insight helps in aligning your tasks with the team's priorities and ensures everyone is on the same page.

          - **Review completed tasks:** Easily track completed Action Items from today, yesterday, and any previous days. This retrospective view not only offers a sense of accomplishment but also aids in evaluating team productivity and planning future tasks more effectively.

          # **Optimize your team’s efficiency**

          - **Enhanced visibility and coordination:** By having a comprehensive overview of the team's planned and completed Action Items, you can better coordinate efforts, avoid overlaps, and identify areas needing more resources.

          - **Streamlined communication:** The Team Planner reduces the need for constant check-ins and meetings, as team members can directly see each other’s planned and completed tasks, fostering a more efficient workflow.


          ***Team Planner - Agenda view***
          ![](image://file?file=${docImage3}&width=1440)

          ***Team Planner - Calendar view***
          ![](image://file?file=${docImage4}&width=1440)

          As you continue to use Action Items in Huly, you’ll discover how they seamlessly integrate into both your personal and team planning processes, elevating the way you manage and execute tasks. The Team Planner is just one of the many ways Huly empowers you and your team to stay organized, synchronized, and productive.

          **Действие** — это задание, готовое к выполнению и назначенное на конкретного участника команды.

          > Но подождите... Мы же создали задачу и назначили её члену команды только что? В чём разница?

          Вкратце:

          - **Задача** — просто работа, которую нужно выполнить.
          - **Действие** — ответственность конкретного человека.

          Когда создается задача со статусом *"To do"* и назначается конкретному участнику команды, он увидит **незапланированное действие**, связанное с этой задачей, в своём личном Планировщике.

          ---

          ### Задание 4 — Запланируйте свое первое действие

          Помните задачу, которую вы только что создали на предыдущем шаге? Поскольку вы установили статус задачи "To do" и назначили её на себя, у вас появилось действие, связанное с этой задачей, которое нужно запланировать к выполнению.

          Перейдите в ваш **Планировщик**, нажав на иконку *календаря* в левой боковой панели. Здесь вы увидите незапланированное действие по задаче, которую вы только что создали!

          Есть **2 способа запланировать действие**:

          - Перетащите незапланированную задачу на свой календарь справа, или
          - Нажмите на незапланированную задачу, чтобы открыть ее в правой боковой панели. Нажмите `Добавить слот`, чтобы создать временной интервал, когда вы планируете выполнить работу. После этого вы можете изменить дату и время, а также добавить больше слотов при необходимости.

          Обратите внимание, что когда вы планируете действие, оно перемещается из раздела *"Не запланировано"* в *"Запланировано"* в вашем списке.

          Теперь вернитесь к **Трекеру**, нажав на иконку с галочкой в левой боковой панели. Обратите внимание, что статус вашей задачи *автоматически обновился* на **"In progress"**! Это произошло, потому что вы запланировали  действие по задаче, выразив своё намерение выполнить работу.

          **Задача** - это конкретное задание, которое необходимо выполнить. Любой проект может быть разбит на задачи и подзадачи.

          ### Задание 3 — Создайте свою первую задачу

          Давайте создадим вашу первую задачу в **Bold**!

          Нажмите синюю кнопку `+ Новая задача` в верхней части боковой панели (или просто нажмите `C`), откроется диалоговое окно создания задачи. 

          > **Совет**: При создании задачи система автоматически выберет тот проект, который вы сейчас просматриваете. Вы можете изменить проект, кликнув на его название в верхнем левом углу диалогового окна и выбрав тот, в который хотите создать задачу сейчас.

          Далее введите информацию о вашей задаче:
          
          - Укажите *имя* и *описание* задачи.
          - Настройте параметры задачи: вы можете назначить задаче **приоритет**, присвоить **метки** или **статус**, задать **оценку** и **срок**, до которого задача должна быть решена.
          - **Исполнителем** будет автоматически выбран пользователь, которого вы выбрали исполнителем по умолчанию при создании проекта. Если это не вы, **назначьте себя** исполнителем задачи.
          - ❗ Установите задаче статус "**To do**" — *это важно для следующего шага*!

          Когда будете готовы, нажмите `Создать задачу`!

          **Проекты** содержат задачи, обычно относящиеся к одной сфере, над которыми будет работать ваша команда. Их можно организовать так, как вам будет удобно.

          Например, команда разработки программного обеспечения может создать проекты под названиями «Frontend», «Backend», «UX/UI» и «Тестирование». Малый бизнес может выбрать такие проекты, как «Поставки и логистика», «Маркетинг» и «Дизайн».

          ---

          ### Задача 2 - Создайте свой первый проект

          Давайте создадим ваш первый проект в **Bold**!

          Убедитесь, что боковая панель Трекер открыта слева  — если её не видно, нажмите на две горизонтальные линии `=`, чтобы её раскрыть.

          Есть два способа создать проект:

          - Нажмите на значок `+` рядом с разделом **Проекты** в боковой панели или
          - Нажмите на значок `∨` рядом с кнопкой `+ Новая задача` и выберите `Создать проект`.

          Укажите **название проекта** и **исполнителя** задач по умолчанию. Также вы можете добавить **описание** проекта, настроить **идентификатор** задач, выбрать **иконку** для проекта и другое. Экспериментируйте!

          Затем нажмите `Создать`!

          # Создание рабочего пространства

          Документы располагаются в рабочих пространствах, которые можно использовать для структурирования информации, используемой вашей командой. Например, вы можете организовать документы в рабочие области с названиями «Маркетинг», «Тестирование», «Стили» и т.д.

          Чтобы создать пространство, нажмите на `+` слева от названия раздела **ПРОСТРАНСТВА** в боковой панели, или нажмите на `∨` рядом с кнопкой `+ Создать документ` и выберите `Создать пространство`.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif1}&width=1440)

          # Создание документа

          Есть два способа создать документ:

          1. Нажмите кнопку `+ Создать документ` в верхней части боковой панели. Откроется диалоговое окно с возможностью выбора рабочего пространства, в котором будет располагаться документ; по умолчанию родительским элементом будет последнее выбранное пространство или документ, вы можете это изменить, если нужно. Введите название документа и нажмите `Создать`.
          2. Либо нажмите на `+` рядом с названием пространства или документа, в котором хотите создать новый документ: тогда он автоматически будет относиться к этому рабочему пространству или документу.

          ![](image://file?file=${docGif2}&width=1440)

          # Форматирование содержимого документа

          Документы поддерживают форматирование с помощью синтаксиса **Markdown**. Существует несколько способов получить доступ к параметрам форматирования текста:

          1. Используйте **синтаксис Markdown** прямо при создании текста документа.
          2. Используйте **правую кнопку мыши**, чтобы раскрыть меню редактирования текста.

          Вы можете форматировать **заголовки**, **выделение текста**, **ссылки**, **цитаты**, **нумерованные и маркированные списки**, а также **блоки кода**.

          Также можно добавлять **изображения**, **таблицы** и **разделительные линии**, наведя курсор на текст и нажав на значок `+`, который появится слева.

          # Использование @упоминаний, действий и совместного редактирования

          Документы полностью интегрированы с остальными функциями **Bold**, что позволяет легко **упоминать членов команды**, назначать **действия** и **ссылаться на задачи**. Члены команды могут работать **совместно** в режиме реального времени: теперь не нужно отправлять файлы туда и обратно или проводить встречи для обсуждения правок.

          ## Упоминания

          Упомяните члена команды, используя синтаксис **@имя**. Упомянутый участник получит уведомление о том, что его упомянули в документе.

          ## Создание действий

          Создайте **действие**, введя `[]` и затем `пробел` на отдельной строке. Либо введите `/` и выберите `Действие` из выпадающего меню. Появится пустой **чекбокс**, и как только вы начнете вводить текст, слева от чекбокса появится значок профиля. Нажмите на этот значок, чтобы выбрать члена команды, которому вы хотите назначить действие. Этот пользователь получит уведомление о назначенном действии и сможет запланировать его в своём Планировщике.

          * [ ] Вы можете назначить действие, наведя курсор на чекбокс и нажав на значок профиля.

          * [ ] Попробуйте назначить эти действия себе!
