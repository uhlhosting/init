**Projects** contain all the tasks your team will be working on, and they can be organized however you’d like. 

For example, a software engineering team may choose to create projects called “Frontend”, “Backend”, “UX/UI” and “Testing”. A small business may choose to create projects like “Inventory”, “Marketing,” and “Design”.

### Task 2 - Create your first project

Let’s create your first project in Huly!

Make sure the Tracker sidebar is open on the left side - if you don’t see it, click the two horizontal lines  `=` to reveal it.

There are two ways to create a project:

* Hover over **YOUR PROJECTS** and click the `+` icon that appears, *or*
* Click the dropdown menu next to the `+ New issue` button and select `Create project`. 

A **title** and **default assignee** are required. You can also add a **description**, choose a custom **identifier** and select an **icon** for your project. 

Next, click `Create`!
